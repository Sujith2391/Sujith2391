Hey there 👋  

I'm **Sujith D**, a Computer Science Engineering student from India.  

I enjoy building software, learning new technologies, and solving real-world problems using code.  
If something interests me, I try to understand it deeply and turn it into a working project.  

My main tech stack includes **JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB**, along with basics of **AI & Machine Learning**.  
I also work with **Python, C/C++**, and enjoy experimenting with new tools and frameworks.  

I've worked on projects like a **College Placement Portal**, **Real-Time Chat Application**, and **ML-based healthcare systems**.  

Most of my repositories are learning-focused and project-based, and I keep improving them step by step.
